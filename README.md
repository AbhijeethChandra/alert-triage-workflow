# Alert Triage Workflow

This repository contains a Product Management assignment focused on designing an **Alert Triage Workflow** for cloud security alerts.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how a cloud security engineer can efficiently **prioritize, investigate, and resolve** cloud security alerts using a simple and structured workflow.

---

## Problem Overview
Cloud security platforms generate a high volume of alerts with varying severity and context. Security engineers often face alert fatigue and limited time to investigate each alert. This workflow aims to simplify alert handling by improving clarity, prioritization, and resolution flow.

---

## User Persona
**Cloud Security Engineer**
- Monitors cloud environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Investigates and resolves security alerts daily
- Needs quick context and clear actions to reduce investigation time

---

## Alert Triage Workflow
The workflow follows a clear lifecycle:

1. Alert is generated
2. Alerts are listed and prioritized
3. Alert details are investigated
4. Appropriate action is taken
5. Alert is resolved and tracked

---

## Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes illustrating the workflow are available in the `wireframes/` folder:

- Screen 1: Alert List (Prioritization)
- Screen 2: Alert Details (Investigation)
- Screen 3: Resolution and Action

---

## Included Files
- `workflow.md` – End-to-end alert triage workflow
- `problem-statement.md` – Problem definition
- `user-persona.md` – Target user understanding
- `feature-writeup.md` – Features, prioritization, and success metrics
- `wireframes/` – Wireframe images and notes

---

## Outcome
This assignment focuses on clarity of problem understanding, simplicity of design, and practical prioritization—aligned with real-world cloud security operations.
