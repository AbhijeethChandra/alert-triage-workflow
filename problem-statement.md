# Problem Statement

Cloud security platforms generate a large number of alerts across cloud environments on a daily basis. These alerts vary in severity and context, making it challenging for cloud security engineers to quickly identify which alerts require immediate attention.

Due to high alert volume and limited investigation time, security engineers often face alert fatigue, delayed responses, and difficulty understanding the root cause and impact of each alert.

There is a need for a simple and structured alert triage workflow that helps security engineers prioritize alerts, understand the issue efficiently, and take appropriate action to resolve cloud security risks in a timely manner.
