# Alert Triage Workflow

This workflow describes how a cloud security engineer investigates and resolves a cloud security alert in a structured and efficient manner.

## Step 1: Alert Generation
A cloud security issue is detected within the cloud environment, such as a misconfiguration or potential exposure. The system generates a security alert and assigns an initial severity level.

## Step 2: Alert Listing and Prioritization
All generated alerts appear in a centralized alert list. The security engineer reviews alerts based on severity, affected cloud resource, and current status to determine which alerts require immediate attention.

## Step 3: Alert Investigation
The engineer selects a specific alert to investigate further. This includes understanding what triggered the alert, identifying the impacted resource, and assessing the potential security risk or business impact.

## Step 4: Action Decision
Based on the investigation, the engineer decides the next action. This may include resolving the issue directly, assigning the alert to another team, marking it as a false positive, or deferring it if the risk is low.

## Step 5: Resolution and Tracking
Once the appropriate action is taken, the alert status is updated to resolved or closed. Notes or comments may be added to document the resolution for future reference and audit purposes.

## Step 6: Workflow Completion
The alert lifecycle is completed, and the engineer proceeds to the next alert with clear visibility into what has been addressed.
